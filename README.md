# Computational Graphics and Visualization Portfolio for CS 330

**How do I approach designing software?**

Usually, when designing software, I focus on the requirements given and try to outline my process either via pseudocode or a flowchart. In the case of this assignment, my design did focus more on understanding the new concepts I was given, rather than focusing on using an exact flowchart. The only times I did outline my process with this particular project was in trying to ensure my vertices lined up properly while attempting to create my 3D scene.

**How do I approach developing programs?**

Developing programs consists of me breaking down each requirement needed and ensuring I have completed or attempted to complete each requirement. With the 3D scene, I had to rework my usual strategies and focus more on researching and understanding these new concepts being introduced. Although my 3D scene still needs work and is not up to my full standards, working through developing this code did teach me how to continue researching and utilizing resources at my disposal. My approach to developing the code has definitely evolved throughout the milestones, especially since I have never utilized nor coded computer graphics before. I had to heavily rely, as I previously stated, on additional resources to understand and develop the project.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

Computer science has provided me with much insight and knowledge so far in my education, especially with how the world works in relation to software and technology. Learning computational graphics and visualizations was a huge challenge for me â€” I was not sure how I was going to be able to get through many of the assignments in this class. However, despite struggling with the milestones and the final project, I did learn a lot about how to use libraries I have never seen before, and how if I work with graphics in the future, to work on interpreting and applying mathematical graphics when necessary. Overall, the skills I gained from this class were beneficial and have provided me insight into a part of computer science that I have always been curious about.
